# C Logic and Bitwise Programs

This repository contains C programs focused on logical problem solving and
bitwise operations. These programs are designed to strengthen low-level
understanding of how data is processed at the binary level.

The aim of this repository is to improve problem-solving skills using operators,
binary logic, and efficient algorithms, which are essential for interviews and
systems-level programming.

## Programs Included

- Addition of two numbers without using '+' operator  
- Multiplication of two numbers without using '*' operator  
- Decimal to Binary Conversion  
- Count Set Bits using Bitwise Operations  

## Concepts Covered

- Bitwise operators (AND, OR, XOR, shift operations)  
- Binary number representation  
- Logical problem solving  
- Efficient algorithms (Brian Kernighan’s Algorithm)  
- Handling edge cases  

## Language Used
- C
